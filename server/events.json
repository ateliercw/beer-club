A hop varietal that we feel is sorely underused, Idaho 7 brings super sticky marmalade notes along with just a tickling of herbal complexity to the already high juice punchbowl of tropical, juicy notes from that world beating base pairing. With everything wrapped up in a big warm hug of our bespoke LA3 yeast strain, this is a beer that is mega hazy, mega juicy, and mega Polly’s."

The whole is rounded off perfectly by impressions of caramel and roast malt. The full taste is malty and fruity in equal measure and achieves the perfect balance between bitter and sweet."

The name of this beer has become a reference for its style, and it is commonly referred to as ‘een Paterke' in Belgium, which is a Dutch nickname for a monk.\n\nSt.Bernardus Pater 6 is a chestnut-brown, dark beer with a creamy head. Impressions of hazelnut and mocha lie at the basis of the mouth feel, which flows into a playful duel between the mild taste of dark candy sugar and a slightly toasted but dry grain character. Plenty of apple and pear aromas make their presence felt all the way to the slightly bitter aftertaste.",
